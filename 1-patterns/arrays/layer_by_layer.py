    Pattern: Layer-by-Layer Processing

    Goal: Process 2D array boundary-by-boundary from outside to center

    When to use: Spiral traversal, matrix rotation, boundary operations
    Problems that use it: Spiral order, rotate matrix, frame extraction
    Key insight: Process outer boundary, recurse on inner (n-2)×(n-2) matrix
