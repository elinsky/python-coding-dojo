    Pattern: Reservoir Sampling / Online Selection

    Goal: Maintain uniform random sample from stream of unknown length

    When to use: Streaming data, unknown input size, memory constraints
    Problems that use it: Online sampling, random selection from stream
    Key insight: nth element included with probability k/n; replace random existing
