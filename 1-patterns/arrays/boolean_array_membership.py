    Pattern: Boolean Array for Set Membership

    Goal: Use array index as implicit key; value tracks membership/state

    When to use: When domain is small integers; need O(1) lookup
    Problems that use it: Sieve of Eratosthenes, count occurrences, seen set
    Key insight: Array position = element value; avoids hash table overhead
