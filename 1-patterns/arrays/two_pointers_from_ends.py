    Pattern: Two Pointers from Ends

    Goal: Partition array by moving elements from both ends toward center

    When to use: When you need to rearrange elements into two groups
    Problems that use it: Even/odd partition, Dutch flag, two-sum in sorted array
    Key insight: Process from both ends simultaneously; O(n) time, O(1) space
