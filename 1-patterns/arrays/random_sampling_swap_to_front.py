    Pattern: Random Sampling with Swap-to-Front

    Goal: Build random subset by swapping selected elements to front

    When to use: Random subset selection, shuffling, sampling without replacement
    Problems that use it: Random sample, random permutation, reservoir sampling
    Key insight: Partition array into [selected | unselected]; shrink unselected region
