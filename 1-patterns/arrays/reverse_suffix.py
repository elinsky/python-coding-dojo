    Pattern: Reverse Suffix to Sort

    Goal: Fix decreasing suffix by reversing it to get increasing order

    When to use: Permutation generation, lexicographic ordering
    Problems that use it: Next permutation, previous permutation
    Key insight: Decreasing suffix reversed = increasing suffix (sorted)
