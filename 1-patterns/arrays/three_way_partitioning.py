    Pattern: Three-Way Partitioning with Invariants

    Goal: Partition into 3 regions (less/equal/greater) in one pass

    When to use: Categorizing elements into multiple groups
    Problems that use it: Dutch flag, sort colors, 3-way quicksort partition
    Key insight: Maintain invariants for 4 regions: bottom/middle/unclassified/top
